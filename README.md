# ELSA_StatMeldr

ELSA StatMeldr is an application that makes fetching data easier.
It does this by fetching data from an external dataset, and storing all of that in a redis Cache.
The reason for the cachie is that it makes filtering the data easier.

At this moment the app supports CBS and RIVM databases.
